# hatchery-cleanup-windows.ps1
# Removes the Hatchery guest directory and all its contents.
#
# Add this as the LAST script in your Clutch's automations list
# if you want to remove all Hatchery artifacts from the guest
# after provisioning completes. Once removed, the Hatchery event
# log becomes the sole audit record.
#
# If omitted, C:\Program Files\Hatchery\ remains on the guest
# as a local audit record containing:
#   logs\hatchery-setup.log    - first-boot setup steps
#   logs\<script-name>.log     - per-script automation events
#
#   automations:
#     - name: hatchery-cleanup-windows.ps1
